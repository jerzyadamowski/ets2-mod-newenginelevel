----
Here is summary how this mod works: Most mechanics in game is OP like loans or AI drivers or best trucks. That why i change it little bit with these areas to make this game challenging.
I want you to have a lot of objectives without attending a second job. Thats why this isnt REALISTIC ECONOMY MOD.

----
First, you have a huge debt in the bank at the start. 1 000 000 Euro (Approx. 15841Euro over 70 days).
Second, Hiring is OP in this game so here is there is hard to hire someone (188K Euro). Tip: Dont hire without truck.
Third, garage will cost you: small: 400K, upgrade: 150K
Fourth, i replaced levels for every engine to balance all trucks. In human it means i prepare formulas that you will use trucks from worst to best. And not because you wanted, but becasue you have to.
Now you can get your first truck from 15 level and more powerful configuration you can get at 100. Details you can get below.
Fifth, offences and police are tweak to more realistic. You dont have to play reckless simulation delivery is lowered from 62km/h to 45km/h.
Sixth, Income is one-third orginal income.
Seventh, A lot of XP for types of cargo, travelled distance, parking ability.
Eighth, cargo is fragile, when you scratch it probably it will cost you all XP and income.
Nineth, loans have huge interest rate.
Tenth, works well only with highest priority around other economy mods and as a new game.

THIS IS WHEN TRUCKS ARE OPEN FOR YOU:
DAF from 21 level.
IVECO from 25 level.
MANs from 41 level.
MERCEDES from 31 level.
RENAULTs from 15 level.
SCANIAs from 55 level.
VOLVOs from 62 level.

I use math to set them quite fair evenly.
HAPPY EXPLORING.
