[normal]From this version were recalculation done because of tucks from DAF and MAN.
There was update in other files than def.scs and i was unaware the lack of these files in def.scs but in other DLC files.
I promise to keep the configuration updated as long as I have all missing DLCs.


[orange]1.3
[normal]All truck's engines are renumerate with new unlock level.
Powerful trucks its harder to get stronger engine, and its opposite of underpowered trucks.
First trucks with around 310-320Hp you can get around 5 level and last engines 730-750 are avaiable at 48-50 level.
